    "You're a senior grid analyst at GridNova Utilities, overseeing a legacy radial distribution network in a semi-rural region. Recently, customer load growth has increased dramatically, particularly in areas served by a single long feeder. This has pushed some branches past their capacity, triggering repeated overloads.\n",
