    "# ⚡ Advanced Power Grid Workshop: Solving an Overload Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a senior grid analyst at GridNova Utilities, overseeing a legacy radial distribution network in a semi-rural region. Recently, customer load growth has increased dramatically, particularly in areas served by a single long feeder. This has pushed some branches past their capacity, triggering repeated overloads.\n",

    "Your task: augment the grid by adding a second substation and relieving the overloaded feeder through targeted switching.\n",

    "## 🎯 Workshop Goals\n",
    "- Detect a line overload after load increase.\n",
    "- Find a suitable node to connect a new substation.\n",
    "- Trace the overloaded route.\n",
    "- Strategically open a line to reroute power and relieve the feeder.\n",
